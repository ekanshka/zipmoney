## Details of Things learnt/covered : 🎊

- Backend :
    - typescript express server
    - users table and accounts table in mongoDB using mongoose orm
    - zod validation for all necessary routes
    - auth routes : 
        - POST "api/v1/user/signup", with assigning user with random balance under 10000 
        - POST "api/v1/user/signin", with jwt token return
    - user routes : 
        - GET "api/v1/user/" , fetching current user information (username, firstname, lastname)
        - PUT "api/v1/user/" , updating their information (firstname, lastname, password with encryption)
        - GET "api/v1/user/bulk", searching for users with or without filter query
    - account routes :
        - GET "api/v1/account/balance", to get their balance
        - POST "api/v1/account/transfer", to transfer money to a another user


- Frontend :
    - typescript vite react - tailwind stack
    - auth pages :

        - "/signin", stores jwt token and redirects to dashboard
    - user pages : 
        - "/dashboard" , shows available users except the current logged in user
        - "/user" , allows users to see their username(email), userid, and editable firstname, lastname fields to update their information. Also allows a delete account option

## Bugs : ❌
- UX related: 
    - search feature works but is case sensitive [fix would require a little structural change with mongo schema and stuff]
    - landing on any random page does not redirect to a working url ex the root url


<!-- ## Run : 🚀 -->
<!-- - Create .env in root folder and set the environment variables JWT_SECRET and MONGO_URL
- Run <code> node index.js </code> in root folder -->
